# TODO List for NLP4CC

## Phase 1: Research and Planning

1. **Research and Gather Climate Change Related APIs**
   - [ ] Identify and list potential APIs related to climate change (e.g., NOAA, NASA, Climate Data Online).
   - [ ] Document the type of data each API provides and their response formats.
   - [ ] Evaluate the relevance and usefulness of the data for the project.


2. **Evaluate LLM APIs**
   - [ ] Compare GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 and GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct.
   - [ ] Determine the best API based on instruction-following capabilities and general performance.
   - [ ] Document the selection process and justification for the chosen LLM API.


3. **Create Project Report/Paper Draft**
   - [ ] Outline the project's objectives and scope.
   - [ ] Include the methodology for using LLMs with climate change APIs.


## Phase 2: Setup and Development

1. **Set Up General Architecture**
   - [ ] Define the overall architecture of the system.
   - [ ] Diagram the flow of data from climate change APIs to the LLM and back.
   - [ ] Create runnable script for each API with user console input (see: GPT4-as-DataAnalyst demo)


2. **Generate and Analyze Responses**
   - [ ] Analyze the LLM's responses to various climate change data inputs.
   - [ ] Evaluate the quality and relevance of the insights generated by the LLM.
   - [ ] Document findings and potential areas for improvement.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Reporting

1. **Implement Code Generation and Plotting**
   - [ ] Extend the system to generate code snippets for data analysis and visualization.
   - [ ] Test the generated code to ensure it produces accurate plots and insights.


2. **Prepare Final Report/Paper**
   - [ ] Compile all research, methodology, results, and discussions into a comprehensive report.
   - [ ] Include visualizations, code snippets, and case studies.
   - [ ] Review and revise the draft for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.


3. **Presentation and Documentation**
   - [ ] Create a presentation summarizing the project's goals, methodology, results, and conclusions.
