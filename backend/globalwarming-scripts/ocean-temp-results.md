_User_: What are the recent ocean warming trends?

#### Response:
1. The ocean temperature anomaly data shows a clear warming trend over the years, with fluctuations in between.
   
2. From the mid-20th century onwards, there is a noticeable increase in ocean temperatures, with a more rapid warming trend observed in recent decades.

3. The years 2016, 2017, and 2020 stand out as having particularly high temperature anomalies, indicating significant ocean warming during those years.

4. The data suggests that ocean warming has been accelerating in recent years, as seen in the increasing temperature anomalies from the early 2000s to the present.

5. The year 2024 recorded the highest temperature anomaly in the dataset, indicating ongoing ocean warming trends that need to be closely monitored and addressed.
